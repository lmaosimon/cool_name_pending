Faculty Page Redesign

    The purpose of this project was to redesign and improve a faculty member's web site. We chose to redesign Michael Bond's website.

    In order to run the build the website and view it:

		Make sure you are in the project directory and enter the command: bundle install

    In order to build the website:

        While still in the project4 directory, enter the command: bundle exec middleman build

        This will create a folder in the project4 directory which contains all the HTML and CSS files.

    In order to view the website:

        Navigate to the build folder with the command: cd build.

        Now, enter the command: firefox index.html &
